	<h1> Domain Abstraction </h1>
	<p> The potential users of this UI include anyone who is interested in understanding 
	how the populations of countries are ranked compared to other countries.
	This UI would also be useful for users who are 
	interested in examining the birthrate and death rate of a 
	specific country. </p>
</section>

	<h1> Data Abstraction </h1>
	<p> The data type of this dataset the CSV file provided. </p>
	
	<p> The hierarchical graph data has a quantitative attribute. It can 
	be shown to measure how large the population is of each country and
	compare them to one another. This a sequential ordering direction
	because there is minimum range of population and there is maximum range
	for the population.  The grouped bar chart also has this 
	quantitative attribute allowing for the birthrate and death rate to
	be measured against each other for the chosen country. </p>
	
	<p> There was preprocessing that took place in order to make 
	the graph readable. First, a second file was created
	with just the countries birthrates and death rates that 
	is used in the "linkedGraph" file. Second,
	when drawing the hierarchical graph, some countries did not 
	have a population, birthrate, or deathrate listed
	and these caused the graph to throw errors. These were removed 
	because of this reason. Fourth, the continent the
	country is on was used instead of region to allow for less 
	sections to be created on the hierarchical graph. </p>

	<h1> Task Abstraction </h1>
	<p> The two tasks supported are the visual representation of the 
	population of the country and being able to compare the birthrate and
	deathrate of the chosen country. </p>

	<p> The hierarchical graph supports the low-level query action, target
	pair. By having an overall view of each country, the user can then
	target the specific country they want to compare. As they mouse-over
	the country, the name and population size appear as a tooltip to
	allow details on demand about the country. </p>

	<p> The grouped bar chart is linked to the country, so it displays the 
	birthrate and deathrate when that country is clicked. This is also
	a low-level query action because it allows the user to choose a country
	based on the hierarchical graph and then allows them to compare the two
	rates side by side.

	<h1> Visualization and Interaction Abstraction </h1>
	<p> The visualizations are shown using two separate graphs. 
	The first visualization is a grouped bar chart that allows the user
	to compare the birthrate and deathrate of the selected country. 
	The second visualization is the hierarchical graph to showing
	the size of the country based on the size of the population. </p>

	<p> The marks are the circles in the hierarchical graph because they
	display area. The channels for this graph are the positions of the circle relative
	to the population size. </p>
	
	<p> The marks for the grouped bar chart are the bars that are represented. The 
	channels are the colors of these bars that allow the user to compare the values. </p>
	
	<p> The visualization supports the marks and channels for each graph
	because they are intuitive to understand. It is easy to tell in the
	hierarchical graph which countries have the largest population and
	which countries have less. The grouped bar chart makes it easy for
	users to understand what two values are being compared with the color
	scale and how they compare to each other based on the size of the bar
	that is created. </p>
	
	<p> I choose these marks and channels for the hierarchical graph because I wanted a simple way
	to represent how countries compare when looking at their population.
	The circles in the hierarchical graph made this visualization easy
	for users to understand and interpret. The channels made the position
	of each circle have a meaning as well. It is easy to tell which countries
	belong on the same continent and the user can zoom in to see what all 
	countries are being represented in the graph. </p>

	<p> I choose the marks and channels for the grouped bar chart because
	this method made the values easy to compare at first glance.
