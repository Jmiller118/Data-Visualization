	<section> <h1> Abortion Rates </h1> 
	<p> Abortion is a hot topic and has been for years. 
	Left side Democrats support abortion rights and hard-core Republicans are against abortion rights.
	 This has been ongoing debate since the landmark decision of Roe v. Wade of 1973. 
	Roe v. Wade gave women the right to chose to have an abortion without restrict government 
	restriction. Today, the argument lies in “my body, my right to choose” 
	to “taking another human’s life”.

	<section> <h1> Left Chart </h1> 
	<p> The left chart is to support Left Side Democrats that abortion rates have barely 
	increased since 1980. This is demonstrated in a line chart that selects all the data 
	from the original dataset. However, the y-axis is skewed to go to 200. This the 
	simplification techinque that drastically reduces the complexity of the data. This allows 
	the line to appear straight for anyone just glancing at the chart. The color and thickness 
	of the line are also important. The green allows the brain to consider it okay since green 
	is associated with things that are not bad, this is a highlighting techinque. The thickness of the line is thin to make the 
	line appear less dramatic helping the argument that the rate has hardly increased. This is the
	visual metaphor tricking the brain into thinking green is good and thin means hardly any change.

	<section> <h1> Right Chart </h1>
	<p> The right chart is to support Right Side Republicans that abortion rates have 
	increased since Roe v. Wade. This is demonstrated in a line chart as well, 
	but only selects a few years of data. The x-axis data is only read in until read 2005 
	due to that being the sharpest line increase. This the the omission techinque
	allowing parts of the data to not be explained. The y-axis is also skewed by starting at 
	eight instead of zero. This is the biasing techique that allows one narrative to be shown over
	another. Another way this chart supports Republicans is the color and width 
	of the line. Red is to indicate is it bad and should be stopped, the thickness makes it stand 
	out more. It appears worse to the eye than the left chart making the argument stronger for 
	increasing. These are visual metaphors that chose different techinques and use associations to make a point.
